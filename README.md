# Air Quality Analysis: Patterns and Trends of Key Pollutant

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) of global air quality data, focusing on pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and O3. The analysis aims to identify key patterns, peak pollution periods, and differences in pollution levels across various cities.

## Key Components
- **Data Cleaning:** Identified and handled missing and erroneous data.
- **Missing Data Imputation:** Implemented interpolation methods to fill gaps.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analyses.
- **Time Series Analysis:** Examined seasonal trends and performed decomposition.
- **Outlier Detection:** Identified and analyzed outliers using statistical methods.

## Results
The analysis provided insights into air quality trends, highlighting significant pollution periods and differences between cities. The interpolation approach effectively maintained data integrity while filling missing values.
